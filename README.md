*Annhub* is a B/S Web platform to scan and reinforce Android APP. According to the serious security threats that Android Application are faced with currently, it adopts some methods of application scanning such as decompile merge, sensitive information scanning, vulnerability scanning and so on. Also, it combines with certain methods of application reinforcement like digital signature, anti- debugging detection, virtual machine packers and confusion which includes code confusion and resource confusion. Based on all the above methods and our efforts, we provide our users with secure and efficient service and platforms for application reinforcement.This platform innovatively introduces security detection scheme based on our own analysis model and the technology of virtual machine protection based on stack, and also does some data analysis on the data we can approach to, through which we effectively and reliably solve hidden security problems that appear when users use their Android applications.
